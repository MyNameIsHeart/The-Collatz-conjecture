# This program regards The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n+1 conjecture.

# Paul Erd≈ës once said (about the Collatz conjecture):
# "Mathematics may not be ready for such problems."

# this short program calculates the total stopping time of a given positive integer

# it may also print the hailstone sequence of the given positive integer

# This program assumes that the conjecture is correct and that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which
# positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.
